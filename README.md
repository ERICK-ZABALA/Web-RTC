# Web RTC

## OVERVIEW
Web RTC is designed to share media streams and where it needs a signal server to exchange SDP (Session Description Protocol) after data Web RTC Data Channel establish a connection directly to exchange data in full-duplex communication between two browsers.
This example is an integration between two peers to share the video using JavaScript and HTML with CSS where create a scenario common with two users.
## Architecture
WebRTC offers web application developers the ability to write rich, realtime multimedia applications (think video chat) on the web, without requiring plugins, downloads or installs. Itâ€™s purpose is to help build a strong RTC platform that works across multiple web browsers, across multiple platforms.

The overall architecture looks something like this:

## PREREQUISITES

* Create a virtual environment to build the server signaling.
* Install WebSocket in your env https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket.
* Create user A and user B using HTML and CSS to build the interface.

# SIGNALING DIAGRAM
* Recommend use this diagram to great your flow in your call, that permit build in correct direction.

# ICE CANDIDATE EXCHANGE
* Recommend use this diagram to great your flow in your call, that permit build in correct direction for alerts or events.

## CONFIGURATION

* Create your virtual environment in Node 14.17 and add the file runtime.txt, install all dependencies indicate in requirements.txt as well add Procfile file.

## RUNNING

* You can run the project first of all in your local machine and then you can use the heroku cloud to work with public network.

# Web RTC

## OVERVIEW
Web RTC is designed to share media streams and where it needs a signal server to exchange SDP (Session Description Protocol) after data Web RTC Data Channel establish a connection directly to exchange data in full-duplex communication between two browsers.
This example is an integration between two peers to share the video using JavaScript and HTML with CSS where create a scenario common with two users.
## Architecture
WebRTC offers web application developers the ability to write rich, realtime multimedia applications (think video chat) on the web, without requiring plugins, downloads or installs. Itâ€™s purpose is to help build a strong RTC platform that works across multiple web browsers, across multiple platforms.

The overall architecture looks something like this:

## PREREQUISITES

* Create a virtual environment to build the server signaling.
* Install WebSocket in your env https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket.
* Create user A and user B using HTML and CSS to build the interface.

## RUNNING

* You can run the project first of all in your local machine and then you can use the heroku cloud to work with public network.

## SEARCHING WITH THIS CODE

* The intention to make this code is to generate curiosity, with them coming new ideas and as consequence arrive the creativity, finally you are in the innovation. Reach out via Cisco Webex ID erickzabala@hotmail.com for any support questions.
